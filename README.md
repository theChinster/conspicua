## What is The Project?

Our project aims to mitigate the effects of the filter bubble by using a data-based approach to introduce novel information into echo chambers. The project is an extension of the PolitEcho Chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/politecho/jcindbcjkekiofoogdiohbdleddkpbbm?hl=en-US). The PolitEcho app scrapes your Facebook feed to figure out the political leaning of your friends. Since your friends preferences and posts determine your feed, this identifies the political leaning of your Facebook feed. Tyler and I want to be clear that we DID NOT write the code for this part of the project (as that would have been extremely difficult and this is not a computer science course). The code we did write allows us to take that data, analyze it, and introduce new perspectives through article tests. Having cultivated articles that introduce new political perspectives, if an individual's political leaning is too far to one side, our app recommends they read an article and give thoughtful feedback and thought to it.
